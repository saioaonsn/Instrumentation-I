Instrumentation I: Projects Portfolio \
\
**A collection of instrumentation projects**\
*University of the Basque Country - Faculty of Science and Technology - Electronic Engineering*\
\
*Repository Overview*\
This repository contains some **projects** and **practical assignments** completed for the **Instrumentation I** course at the University of the Basque Country.\
\
*Course objectives*\
The aim of this course is to introduce the fundamental concepts of **electronic instrumentation systems**, independent of their application field. It covers the experimental characterization of physical magnitudes, including sensors, noise and electromagnetic interference, basic signal acquisition and conditioning techniques, as well as an introduction to signal generation, modulation, and data acquisition systems. 


\
*Acquired Technical Skills*
- Describe measurement system principles, calibration and error analysis.
- Understand sensor operation and practical measurement challenges. 
- Identify and minimize noise and electromagnetic interference effects.
- Analyze and design circuits for signal conditioning and data acquisition.
- Use software tools for circuit analysis, virtual instrumentation, and instrument control.
- Communicate instrumentation knowledge and results effectively.
